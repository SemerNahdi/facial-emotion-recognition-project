## Overview

This project implements an emotion recognition system using a pre-trained VGG16 model. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training with fine-tuning, evaluation, and visualization of results. The primary objective is to classify emotions from images accurately.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes VGG16 for effective feature extraction.
- **Data Augmentation**: Increases dataset variability to improve model robustness.
- **Model Checkpointing**: Automatically saves the best models during training.
- **Early Stopping**: Halts training when no improvement is detected.
- **Visualization**: Leverages TensorBoard for monitoring training progress.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorBoard

Create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013?resource=download).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-recognition.git
    cd emotion-recognition
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Preparation

1. Organize your raw images into the following directory structure:

    ```
    data/
    └── train/
        ├── angry/
        ├── disgust/
        ├── fear/
        ├── happy/
        ├── neutral/
        ├── sad/
        └── surprise/
    ```

2. Run the data preprocessing script:

    ```bash
    python scripts/data_processing.py
    ```

   This will generate the preprocessed data in the `preprocessed_data/` directory.

## File Descriptions

- **data_processing.py**: Processes the raw images and prepares them for training, including resizing, normalization, and dataset splitting.
  
- **model_training.py**: Trains the VGG16 model on the prepared dataset, implementing data augmentation, checkpointing, and early stopping.

- **evaluate_model.py**: Evaluates the model's performance on the validation set, generating classification reports and confusion matrices.

- **predict_emotion.py**: Predicts the emotion of new images based on the trained model. Specify the image path to classify the emotion.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required to run the project for easy installation.

- **models/**: Stores the trained models, including best checkpoints and logs for TensorBoard.

- **preprocessed_data/**: Contains preprocessed images ready for training.

- **logs/**: Stores TensorBoard logs for visualizing training progress.

## Model Training

To train the model, execute:

```bash
python scripts/model_training.py
```

### Interrupting and Resuming Training

- **Interrupt**: Press `Ctrl + C` during training to stop it.
- **Resume**: Re-run the training script, which will automatically load from the last checkpoint.

## Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model using:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
```

This will generate classification reports and confusion matrices.

## Prediction

To classify emotions in new images, run:

```bash
python scripts/predict_emotion.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
```

The output will display the predicted emotion for the specified image.

## Visualization

To visualize training progress, start TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/
```

Then, access it in your browser at `http://localhost:6006/`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Model Not Loading**: Check for `FileNotFoundError`. Ensure model files exist.
- **Data Loading Errors**: Verify that `.npy` files are present and correctly formatted.
- **Overfitting**: Increase regularization or implement more data augmentation.
- **Underfitting**: Consider increasing model complexity or extending the training duration.

## Final Recommendations

- Regularly monitor training progress using TensorBoard.
- Backup important files and models frequently.
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Stay updated with the latest research in emotion recognition.

## Workflow Summary

1. **Setup**: Create a virtual environment and install packages.
2. **Data Preparation**: Organize and preprocess data.
3. **Model Training**: Train and fine-tune the model.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance.
5. **Prediction**: Classify emotions in new images.
6. **Visualization**: Use TensorBoard to track training progress.
